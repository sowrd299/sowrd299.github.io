This game started with the marriage of two mechanics I wanted to try out: having cards server different roles based on where the player placed them, and having a maximum amount of card-power the player can have across the board. The rest of the game flowed from this basic premise; for example, once I realized that efficiency of cards on the board to point on the board would be a big part of the gameplay, I starting learning into the idea that card advantage is central to this games gamestate, such as with the boost mechanic. While it is perfectly serviceable, the Develop area has never been quite as impactful as I have wanted it to be, and allocating between attack and defense tends to be a bit on the straight-forward side.
