Reapers is an attempt to incorpate a handleful of mechanics from modern CCG's that I particularly like, such as persistent resources and deckbuilding centered around specific characters, and modern modern fantasy theme. The game is a medium-heavy strategy game, that prioritizes being strategic, and thematically compelling. The biggest problem it it is currently facing is the power of the Malakhim; while tthese cards have a roll to play in progressing the game through mid, early and late game, too often the player who draws more Malakhim also wins. I hope to find a satisfactory system for playing Malakhim that is more consistent than drawing them from the deck. The game also has a length issue; it tends to overstay it's welcome somewhat, but this seems mostly to be a matter of finding the sweet spot for the win condition.
