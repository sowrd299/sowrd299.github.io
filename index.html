            <p id="blip">If I had to call a single game my "magnum opus", it would have to be Vitium. While it is not my best game, it is the one I have put the most time in, and the one I have believed in through the most setbacks. It is an attempt at being a multi-player politcal card game, that allows players to wheel and deal and betray eachother, and that asks the player to embrase the phatasy of being an imoral, selfish crimelord; Vampire: the Eternal struggle for the modern age. It always has been very ambisious, but I have longed believed there is something special it can be that nothing else today is. It has had problems being simple enough to being reasonable to learn.
