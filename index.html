    <h1>My Games</h1> 
    <p>Here I've currated a small number of my favorite games that I've made over the years. While not every game 
        represents the best of what I can do, every game was selected to represent something
        I am proud of. Some of them represent something weird and interesting that I tried, some of these games
        represent major lessons they taught me as a designer, and some of them I just like a lot.
